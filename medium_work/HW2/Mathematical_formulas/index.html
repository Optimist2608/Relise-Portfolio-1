            <h2 class="h2">Linear Equations</h2>
            <p class="p">
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form </p> <br>
                <div class="form">
                ax + b = 0  
                </div><br>
                <p class="p">where <span class="red">a</span> and <span class="red">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="red">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="red">x</span> so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="red">x</span> there.

            <h2 class="h2">Quadratic Equation</h2>
            <p class="p">
            The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p><br>
<div class="form">
    ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0  
</div><br><p class="p">
where <span class="red">a</span>, <span class="red">b</span>, <span class="red">c</span> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="red">a</span> can't be 0.

<div class="form">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></div><br>

<p class="p">or, when you know the diameter</p> (<span class="red">D</span>):<br>
<div class="form">A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></div> <br> 

<p class="p">or, when you know the circumference</p> (<span class="red">C</span>):<br>

            <p class="p">
            The intersection of two sets <span class="red">A</span> and <span class="red">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p><br>

<div class="form">A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B } </div> <br>

<p class="p">That is, <span class="red">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="red">x</span> is both an element of <span class="red">A</span> and an element of <span class="red">B</span>.
